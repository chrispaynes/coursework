<!-- I am Karl Jensen, Owner and Property Manager of HRMC since 2006.  My wife, Tracie and I met while attending UW-Stout and working at Jake's Supper Club and became very fond of Menomonie.  In fact, we liked it so much that we decided to keep a connection to the booming little town and became property owners.  We currently own and manage 10 four bedroom apartment buildings and 1 three bedroom townhouse.  
 
We live an hour away and have a cabin on Tainter Lake in Menomonie, so we are readily available for apartment showings and maintenance needs.  We respond to emails and text messages as soon as possible within normal business hours (8:00 am-5:00 pm), or through our website. -->
