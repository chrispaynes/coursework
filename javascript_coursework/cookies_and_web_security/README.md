### About
Two-part order form for Eating Well in Season (EWS), a business in Glover, Vermont. EWS wants to enable new customers to sign up online. However, the company is concerned that making a web form to collect all the necessary information would be challenging to fill out on a handheld device like a mobile phone. To address this concern, they hired a designer to create a form that's split into two parts: one document that collects basic customer information, and a second document that allows users to specify their service preferences. EWS has asked you to write the JavaScript code necessary for all of the form information to be submitted at once.
